            <h4>11/05/2025</h4>
            <h4>By Shy Moai</h4>
            <br>
            <p>On may 11th 2025, the president of Narconcilia, Shy Moai , declares "I will not be running for prime minister, my opponents are too strong". He then precised later it was mainly 
                because, as he was already president, he wanted to give a chance to the other candidates to win the elections. The two remaining candidates for the position of Prime Minister are
                Kittanaaa and Neon Sheep. Here is a brief presentation of the both candidates to guide you in your choice.</p>
            <h3>Kittanaaa</h3>
            <p>Kittanaaa is a member of the discord since April 7th 2025 and became a Narconcilian citizen on April 20th 2025. Since then, he has been very invested in both the micronation and the
                community. He is one of the fastest people to reach level 20, reaching it in only 11 days. As soon as he got his citizenship, he read all the laws and corrected a lot of mistakes Shy
                Moai made when he wrote the laws for example, mistranslations or continuity errors. He is also very invested in the events and in the economy aspect of the Micronation, almost
                studying all the possible ways to make money and their benefits. He is currently at more than a month or rat time and is still on 
                <a href="https://spinningrat.online" target="_blank">spinningrat.online</a>. Now, here is a short summary of his campaign and his promises :
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Correcting all the errors in the laws documents</li>
                <li>Creating a bot for the auctions system</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Neon Sheep</h3>
            <p>Neon Sheep joined the discord serve on October 5th 2024 and became a citizen of Narconcilia on May 4th 2025. He is devoted to spinning rats, not only in the discord where he is level 5
                but also everywhere else. He is an active promoter of Narconcilia and the discord in many other discord servers and other places. On February 19th 2025, he created an embassy in Texas,
                making him the second person to ever create an embassy after of course Shy Moai. He created this embassy before even becoming a citizen, but it still got recognized as an official
                embassy by Shy Moai at the time. Neon Sheep currently has 5 minutes of rat time and unfortunately isn't still on <a href="https://spinningrat.online" target="_blank">spinningrat.online</a>.
                Once again, here is a brief summary of his campaign and promises :
                <ul>
                    <li>Bring movie night once per month</li>
                    <li>Getting recognized by other micronations and nations</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>Now, you deicide. Will you vote for Kittanaa, with his small, but realistic promises. Or will you vote for Neon Sheep with his bigger dreams ? Because with a population of only 10
                citizens, your vote truly matters. For now, none of the candidates has faced some real issues with his campaign but after all, it is only the first day and the election is in 19 days,
                on may 30th so everything can still change.
