            <h1>How the Spinning Rat Meme was Born</h1>

            <h4>09/06/2025</h4>
            <h4>By Duck</h4>
            <br>
            <p>It all began with a pixelized rodent and a hypnotic spin.In an age where digital trends come and go in the blink of an eye, the Spinning Rat meme has managed to carve out a peculiar
                corner of the internet. Both absurd and strangely endearing, this endlessly twirling rat has captured the imagination of millions; turning an unlikely rodent into a viral icon. But
                how exactly did this dizzy little creature spin its way into web history?</p>
            <h3>The Emergence of the Spinning Meme</h3>
            <p>The exact origin of this meme is a well hidden rabbit hole but since there was no starting point, as it evolved within the community over the time from far before the spinning meme
                like the spinning potato chips or the spinning rat meme appeared. However, several early examples and related memes have contributed to its development. In 2004, many videos about
                characters spinning on "You Spin Me Round (Like a Record)" by Dead or Alive soundtrack. Since then, the spinning and the looped music thing really started catching people's
                attention. In 2006, the Loituma Girl meme was released by Leekspin and is now right under the one million views milestone.</p>
            <h3>The Spinning Meme Explosion</h3>
            <p>On September 25th, 2020, the user @MrFatCatMan uploaded a GIF of a fish spinning while the music "Bumpy Ride, Nightcore Version" by Mohombi. This marked the beginning of the modern era
                of the spinning meme. During the months following this event, the meme became famous and many of the legendary memes as “spinning chips”, “spinning roach” and “spinning chair” were
                uploaded just after. In the years following the spinning fish release, the spinning meme accumulated from 150 millions to 250 millions views on the main social media platforms.</p>
            <h3>The Rise of the Spinning Rat: From Deus Ex to Meme Icon</h3>
            <p>On March 19th, 2020, a Fandom user known as @Hawkybird uploaded an unusual image to the Deus Ex Wiki. Released on the "Animals" page, the GIF of a low resolution rat from the 2000
                video game Deus Ex, spinning on its axis with the caption: "A rotating image of a rat.", was firstly left out and forgotten. Months later, on November 24th, 2020, the surreal image 
                resurfaced on Twitter. The gimmick account @LowPolyAnimals, known for posting pixelized and retro-styled animals, shared the GIF. The post quickly gained popularity, reaching over 
                2,000 retweets and nearly 14,000 likes in the span of two years. But it was in March 2021 that the rotating rodent fully entered meme lore. On March 29th, a 4chan user named @Munashe 
                uploaded a 3D animation of a spinning low-poly rat. The animation spread rapidly across platforms, celebrated for its absurd simplicity. By August 24th, 2021, it had reached Tenor's 
                GIF library thanks to user @doseshipment, ensuring its place in countless text threads and meme compilations.</p>
            <h3>The Spinning Rat Meme Variations</h3>
            <p>While horizontal spinning rat memes was at its peak in 2021, some upload of rat spinning vertically, diagonally, in 4k quality or with no more than 8 pixels were released. Dedicated 
                users were trying to add their absurd variant of spinning rat spinning in their own way to the spinning rat monument. On November 9 of 2023, @twotwelve, an independent programming 
                team, almost immediately gathered dozens of spinning rats lovers on their new website, spinningrat.online .</p>
            <br>
            <p>The next paragraph was added by Shy_Moai-----></p>
            <p>Now, this is only a tiny part of the story of spinning rats. There is many more things to be explored like how did spinningrat.online become so popular or how did many youtube channels, 
                discord servers and more were created, containing only rat videos or content. So MAYBE, if enough support is showed for this article, there will be a sequel, either by Duck or by someone
                else...</p>

            <img src="https://file.garden/Z8moUZIjfg3Igpm6/%F0%9F%91%89%F0%9F%91%88.png" width="512">
            <h4>11/05/2025</h4>
            <h4>By Shy Moai</h4>
            <br>
            <p>On may 11th 2025, the president of Narconcilia, Shy Moai , declares "I will not be running for prime minister, my opponents are too strong". He then precised later it was mainly 
                because, as he was already president, he wanted to give a chance to the other candidates to win the elections. The two remaining candidates for the position of Prime Minister are
                Kittanaaa and Neon Sheep. Here is a brief presentation of the both candidates to guide you in your choice.</p>
            <h3>Kittanaaa</h3>
            <p>Kittanaaa is a member of the discord since April 7th 2025 and became a Narconcilian citizen on April 20th 2025. Since then, he has been very invested in both the micronation and the
                community. He is one of the fastest people to reach level 20, reaching it in only 11 days. As soon as he got his citizenship, he read all the laws and corrected a lot of mistakes Shy
                Moai made when he wrote the laws for example, mistranslations or continuity errors. He is also very invested in the events and in the economy aspect of the Micronation, almost
                studying all the possible ways to make money and their benefits. He is currently at more than a month or rat time and is still on 
                <a href="https://spinningrat.online" target="_blank">spinningrat.online</a>. Now, here is a short summary of his campaign and his promises :
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Correcting all the errors in the laws documents</li>
                <li>Creating a bot for the auctions system</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Neon Sheep</h3>
            <p>Neon Sheep joined the discord serve on October 5th 2024 and became a citizen of Narconcilia on May 4th 2025. He is devoted to spinning rats, not only in the discord where he is level 5
                but also everywhere else. He is an active promoter of Narconcilia and the discord in many other discord servers and other places. On February 19th 2025, he created an embassy in Texas,
                making him the second person to ever create an embassy after of course Shy Moai. He created this embassy before even becoming a citizen, but it still got recognized as an official
                embassy by Shy Moai at the time. Neon Sheep currently has 5 minutes of rat time and unfortunately isn't still on <a href="https://spinningrat.online" target="_blank">spinningrat.online</a>.
                Once again, here is a brief summary of his campaign and promises :
                <ul>
                    <li>Bring movie night once per month</li>
                    <li>Getting recognized by other micronations and nations</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>Now, you deicide. Will you vote for Kittanaa, with his small, but realistic promises. Or will you vote for Neon Sheep with his bigger dreams ? Because with a population of only 10
                citizens, your vote truly matters. For now, none of the candidates has faced some real issues with his campaign but after all, it is only the first day and the election is in 19 days,
                on may 30th so everything can still change.
