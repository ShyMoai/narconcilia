            <h4>14/09/2025</h4>
            <h4>By Shy Moai</h4>
            <br>
            <p>Since the creation of Narconcilia, every action the government took, every law the citizens suggested, every decision we took as a community have been based around one big goal : promoting Narconcilia
                from a micronation to a real nation. But what do we really need to make Narconcilia into a nation ? If we compare Narconcilia to other bigger nations, we can see that there are some concepts and system
                that Narconcilia do not have yet. Not only that, but if we want to become a nation, we need to function as a nation too. So now that we know that, what are the big priorities of Narconcilia at the moment
                and how do they contribute to making Narconcilia closer to a real nation ?
            </p>
            <h3>Recongnition from the UN</h3>
            <p>To be considered a "nation" or country, we basically only need to fill out one criteria. Be recognized as a country by all members of the United Nations. This means that the official governement
                countries that are part of the UN must consider Narconcilia as a country of its own. Now, to get recognition in the fiirst place there are a few must-have. Some of these must-have are achievable for 
                Narconcilia in a close future and some other are a lot more difficult. And obviously, we can't talk about all of them in a single newspaper article. So here is the top 10 of these requirements, from 
                hardly possible to easily achievable
            </p>
            <ol reversed>
                <li><h3>Army</h3>Ah yes, let's convince people to fight against a army of thousands of people that have tanks with only like a knife. Not a real requirement though, many real-life nations (like Vatican) don't have a functional army</li>
                <li><h3>Healthcare and education</h3>How are we going to have a consistent education system if we have territories everywhere in the world. Also what on earth are we going to teach in history class ?? Healthcare has pretty much the same problem as army.</li>
                <li><h3>Defined Borders</h3>Unless we have someone ready to negotiate for months with other countries to agree on where do our borders start and where do they end, this is going to be very tedious and difficult.</li>
                <li><h3>Basic needs</h3>This includes all the things like access to clean water, access to electricity and access to housing. This is once again an issue because the Naroncilian territory is way too spread out. It will be difficult to have a sewage system for every embassy.</li>
                <li><h3>Tax system</h3>Obviously, if we want to offer some basic services as a government you need to get funds. Now the real problem is how do we make a tax system so that the super rich can't evade taxes and how do we tax people's possesions that are outside of Narconcilia. So basically a lot of smaller problems for this.</li>
                <li><h3>Functionning laws</h3>Yes, this could take a while to set up but I feel like if everyone helps a bit for the law writing, we can get this done, even if our law system might not be perfect at first, I'm pretty confident it can be functionning.</li>
                <li><h3>Permanent residents</h3>These are people that live in Naroncilia, are bound by the laws of Narconcilia and live with Narconcilia system. We basically just need motivated and reasonable citizens and we're set.</li>
                <li><h3>Functionning Economy</h3>Why is this so far down the list ? Because it will be implemented in Narconcilia in only a few months ! You will finally be able to pay your Naroncilian </li>
                <li><h3>Governemnt</h3>Not only do we have a government, we have a more democratic one than the vast majority of current real nations. </li>
                <li><h3>Citizens</h3>We already have those !</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Naroncilian economy</h3>
                <p><i>This is what you came here for isn't it ?</i></p>
                <p>In the last two government meetings, the major subject was to develop an economy system for Narconcilia. And even if the trade system hasn't been developped as deeply as the other aspects, it is
                    one of those things that just creates itself. The currency would be ratters (ratts in french) and you could pay with special coins that would be produced by the N.I.E.T. The coins would be in plastic
                    so they would be lighter and cheaper to produce than metal coins as well as being eaasily 3d printable. Each coin would be of a different shape to make it easier for people with disabilities to distinguish
                    one coin from another. The edges of the coins are rounded to prevent possible injuries and inconvenience while using them. A list of the shapes and values of the current coin designs is 
                    available at the end of the article. The coins will first be a pilote project, being only available to people living in proximity of the N.I.E.T. production center because long distance
                    transactions would be much harder to regulate and be much less efficient. Then, if after a few months, we see the economy system is used and works well, it would be expanded to the international. A bank 
                    managed by the N.I.E.T. would hold people's assets and could allow long distance transaction. Using a pre-determined password, a user could tranfer some of its coins to another user. The bank would then move
                    the amount of coins from one account to the other. Users could deposit or withdraw coins at any given time by seeing a N.I.E.T. banker and asking for the operation to happen.                
                </p>
            <h3>N.I.E.T.</h3>
            <p>The NIET or Naroncilian Institute of Economy and Trade (INEC in french for Institut Naroncilien de l'Économie et du Commerce) will be an organization that would be managed by a government member
                designed by a vote amongst all members. It would consist of any citizens that would like to participate in developping the Naroncilian economy. The members of the NIET would manage transactions via the bank, 
                search for ways to improve our economy system and present those at government meetings. Basically specialists in the field of the economy so not 2 or 3 person do everythiing in the micronation. Other
                organizations will also probably soon be created to try and motivate people to help improve Narconcilia. If you want to design logos and flags, if you want to write newspaper articles, if you want to 
                write laws or anything else, you will be able to do it with other people that are also interested in the same field. So if you are interested by any of these (NIET included), clearly state it either in 
                a public chatroom of Naroncilia or privately dm Shy Moai if you dont want to share it with other citizens for some reason.

            <h4>30/08/2025</h4>
            <h4>By Shy Moai, debate by Neon Sheep</h4>
            <br>
            <p>After over 2 months of incactivity, the Naroncilian newspaper is back for the second elections of Narconcilia. After a first election that didn't go exactly as planned, Narconcilia had a
                fairly normal second election. This month, only two candidates unlike June's 3 candidates. Neon Sheep is still a candidate, for the second election in a row and a new candidate took part
                to this month's elections, KingDuck10th. From the debate between the two candidates to the actual results of this election, here is everything you might have missed : </p>
            <h3>The debate</h3>
            <p>A debate happened on August 28th 2025, opposing Neon Sheep to KingDuck10th and overall summarizing their plans and ideas for Narconcilia pretty well. Whitout further ado, here are the
                questions I thought were the most interesting. :</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>What is your long-term vision for Narconcilia, and how do you plan to achieve it? </b><br>
                    Neon Sheep : I want to establish diplomatic relations with other micronations and increase commmunity engagement.<br>
                    KingDuck10th : I want to increase community engagement and focus on the economy to make sure it's done right.
                </li><br>
                <li><b>What is your top priority in your first week if you are elected ?</b><br>
                    N : Hiring a minister to start diplomatic relations with other micronations and increase community engagement.<br>
                    K : Increase community engagment and insure that all ongoing projects and handled correctly.
                </li><br>
                <li><b>What values do you want Narconcilia to stand for ?</b><br>
                    N : Peace, freedom and hating non spinning rats. <br>
                    K : Freedom and independence
                </li><br>
                <li><b>How will you resolve conflicts fairly whitout favoritism ?</b><br>
                    N : Asking others outside of Narconcilian for their opinion and respecting the majority.<br>
                    K : Listen to the community to make sure everyone understands each other correctly.
                </li><br>
            </ul>

            <h3>Results of the election</h3>
            <p>The election happened on August 29th and on August 30th, the results were annouced. Neon Sheep won the second election with over 75% of the votes. The voter turnout was a lot less impressive
                than last year with only 6 people out of 12 citizens voted, giving the eleciton a 50% voter turnout, lower than most elections in other countries. Due to the recent changes in laws concerning
                the governemnt, 4 new ministers were named : Kittanaa, Mr.Rat, Scrawny Motherfucker and KingDuck10th. To celebrate his victory, Neon Sheep organized a jackbox night, originally planning to design
                the winner as minister but changed his mind when he realized it could lead to some controversy.
            </p>
            <p>Now, it isnt because the elecitons is over than no interesting things will happen in Narconcilia. It's even the opposite. A lot of major events for Naconcilia are about to unfold this month like the
                first Narconcilian Ratters, the new official money of Narconcilia. Shy Moai plans to print the first ones around septembers 5th, and that will be when we'll see how well the idea will work. We will
                also soon see the first official managers of different fields in the next few weeks. Managers are citizens designed by the governemnt to specialize in one field of Narconcilia's development like for
                example, there could be a finance manager or a information manager or even a culture manager. Unfortunately, there is not quite enough space in this conclusion to talk about all of this in details
                but I can assure you that the Narconcilian newspaper will cover these subjeccts when they happen.

            <h1>Narconcilia elections of June 2025 - What happened ?</h1>
            <img src="https://file.garden/Z8moUZIjfg3Igpm6/klkl" width="512">
            <h4>15/06/2025</h4>
            <h4>By Shy Moai</h4>
            <br>
            <p>After not one, but two elections, Narconcilia finally has a prime minister and three ministers. Now, the plans, reactions and even the precise results of the elections were still not
                very clear. This is mainly due to the fact that the second election did not get as much attention as the first time. This is why Shy Moai asked everyone to write an article on the 
                elections, even promising a pay to whoever wrote the article. Unfortunately, no article was submitted and not much was explained. Now, here is everything you need to know about the
                first elections of Narconcilia.</p>
            <h3>Why a Second Election ?</h3>
            <p>After the first election, when the results were compiled to find the winner, something weird was observed. 12 votes had been casted but only 11 people were Narconcilian citizens at
                the time. Additionally, 2 citizens said that they did not vote, thus meaning at least 3 votes in the 12 votes were not valid. The election was then cancelled and another one was
                triggered on June 8th. This time, the voters had to include their Narconcilian ID, an 11 character code that is unique to each citizen. That way, any form of cheating would be
                prevented.</p>
            <h3>The Results</h3>
            <p>On June 9th, the results were annouced : Kittanaaa won the first elections of Narconcilia. He then chose his ministers. Mr.Rat, Scrawny Motherfucker and Neon Sheep were chosen and
                became the first ministers of Narocncilia. 11 people out of the 11 citizens of Narconcilia voted this election, making the voter turnout 100%, which is extremely rare. But it is not
                that suprising as Narconcilia has a lot less citizens that other countries, making reaching a voter turnout of 100% much easier. Now, here is a deeper analysis of the election's results.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Kittanaaa was placed higher than Neon Sheep in 73% of ballots</li>
                <li>Neon Sheep was placed higher than Shy Moai in 55% of ballots</li>
                <li>Kittanaaa was placed higher than Shy Moai in 82% of ballots</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>What Now ?</h3>
            <p>When the two candidates were asked if they were going to present themselves as president next month, both said yes. We still do not know if other people will present themselves but after
                all, the next forced election is in two whole months so anything can still happen. It doesn't looks like the results of the election angered or triggered anybody so the possibility of an
                early vote next month  is really low. Concerning the plans of Kittanaaa for the future, he said "I plan to revise laws, add laws, improve our economy, and generally try to help our community.
                I also plan to make our government more democratic.". Shy Moai also has a lot of plans for the future, including the addition of laws on the creation and modification of laws, on the
                functionning of government meetings as well as a potentially reliable economic system. Neon Sheep also doesn't give up on getting recognition from other micronations and plans to try to contact
                some other micronations soon. </p>
            <p>With a real government, a way to communicate information to everyone and an invested community, Narconcilia is now getting closer and closer to a real nation. The great land of spinning rats is
                growing at an insane rate, going from 3 citizens and a few laws to 12 citizens, a website, a government and lots of ambitions. And now, with a lot more decisions to take, the government meetings
                should start soon and bring all the projects of the citizens to life.

            <h1>How the Spinning Rat Meme was Born</h1>
            <img src="https://file.garden/Z8moUZIjfg3Igpm6/cover1.jpg" width="512">
            <h4>09/06/2025</h4>
            <h4>By Duck</h4>
            <br>
            <p>It all began with a pixelized rodent and a hypnotic spin.In an age where digital trends come and go in the blink of an eye, the Spinning Rat meme has managed to carve out a peculiar
                corner of the internet. Both absurd and strangely endearing, this endlessly twirling rat has captured the imagination of millions; turning an unlikely rodent into a viral icon. But
                how exactly did this dizzy little creature spin its way into web history?</p>
            <h3>The Emergence of the Spinning Meme</h3>
            <p>The exact origin of this meme is a well hidden rabbit hole but since there was no starting point, as it evolved within the community over the time from far before the spinning meme
                like the spinning potato chips or the spinning rat meme appeared. However, several early examples and related memes have contributed to its development. In 2004, many videos about
                characters spinning on "You Spin Me Round (Like a Record)" by Dead or Alive soundtrack. Since then, the spinning and the looped music thing really started catching people's
                attention. In 2006, the Loituma Girl meme was released by Leekspin and is now right under the one million views milestone.</p>
            <h3>The Spinning Meme Explosion</h3>
            <p>On September 25th, 2020, the user @MrFatCatMan uploaded a GIF of a fish spinning while the music "Bumpy Ride, Nightcore Version" by Mohombi. This marked the beginning of the modern era
                of the spinning meme. During the months following this event, the meme became famous and many of the legendary memes as “spinning chips”, “spinning roach” and “spinning chair” were
                uploaded just after. In the years following the spinning fish release, the spinning meme accumulated from 150 millions to 250 millions views on the main social media platforms.</p>
            <h3>The Rise of the Spinning Rat: From Deus Ex to Meme Icon</h3>
            <p>On March 19th, 2020, a Fandom user known as @Hawkybird uploaded an unusual image to the Deus Ex Wiki. Released on the "Animals" page, the GIF of a low resolution rat from the 2000
                video game Deus Ex, spinning on its axis with the caption: "A rotating image of a rat.", was firstly left out and forgotten. Months later, on November 24th, 2020, the surreal image 
                resurfaced on Twitter. The gimmick account @LowPolyAnimals, known for posting pixelized and retro-styled animals, shared the GIF. The post quickly gained popularity, reaching over 
                2,000 retweets and nearly 14,000 likes in the span of two years. But it was in March 2021 that the rotating rodent fully entered meme lore. On March 29th, a 4chan user named @Munashe 
                uploaded a 3D animation of a spinning low-poly rat. The animation spread rapidly across platforms, celebrated for its absurd simplicity. By August 24th, 2021, it had reached Tenor's 
                GIF library thanks to user @doseshipment, ensuring its place in countless text threads and meme compilations.</p>
            <h3>The Spinning rat meme</h3>
            <p>While horizontal spinning rat memes was at its peak in 2021, some upload of rat spinning vertically, diagonally, in 4k quality or with no more than 8 pixels were released. Dedicated 
                users were trying to add their absurd variant of spinning rat spinning in their own way to the spinning rat monument. On November 9 of 2023, @twotwelve, an independent programming 
                team, almost immediately gathered dozens of spinning rats lovers on their new website, spinningrat.online .</p>
            <br>
            <p>The next paragraph was added by Shy_Moai-----></p>
            <p>Now, this is only a tiny part of the story of spinning rats. There is many more things to be explored like how did spinningrat.online become so popular or how did many youtube channels, 
                discord servers and more were created, containing only rat videos or content. So MAYBE, if enough support is showed for this article, there will be a sequel, either by Duck or by someone
                else...</p>

            <h4>11/05/2025</h4>
            <h4>By Shy Moai</h4>
            <br>
            <p>On may 11th 2025, the president of Narconcilia, Shy Moai , declares "I will not be running for prime minister, my opponents are too strong". He then precised later it was mainly 
                because, as he was already president, he wanted to give a chance to the other candidates to win the elections. The two remaining candidates for the position of Prime Minister are
                Kittanaaa and Neon Sheep. Here is a brief presentation of the both candidates to guide you in your choice.</p>
            <h3>Kittanaaa</h3>
            <p>Kittanaaa is a member of the discord since April 7th 2025 and became a Narconcilian citizen on April 20th 2025. Since then, he has been very invested in both the micronation and the
                community. He is one of the fastest people to reach level 20, reaching it in only 11 days. As soon as he got his citizenship, he read all the laws and corrected a lot of mistakes Shy
                Moai made when he wrote the laws for example, mistranslations or continuity errors. He is also very invested in the events and in the economy aspect of the Micronation, almost
                studying all the possible ways to make money and their benefits. He is currently at more than a month or rat time and is still on 
                <a href="https://spinningrat.online" target="_blank">spinningrat.online</a>. Now, here is a short summary of his campaign and his promises :
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Correcting all the errors in the laws documents</li>
                <li>Creating a bot for the auctions system</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Neon Sheep</h3>
            <p>Neon Sheep joined the discord serve on October 5th 2024 and became a citizen of Narconcilia on May 4th 2025. He is devoted to spinning rats, not only in the discord where he is level 5
                but also everywhere else. He is an active promoter of Narconcilia and the discord in many other discord servers and other places. On February 19th 2025, he created an embassy in Texas,
                making him the second person to ever create an embassy after of course Shy Moai. He created this embassy before even becoming a citizen, but it still got recognized as an official
                embassy by Shy Moai at the time. Neon Sheep currently has 5 minutes of rat time and unfortunately isn't still on <a href="https://spinningrat.online" target="_blank">spinningrat.online</a>.
                Once again, here is a brief summary of his campaign and promises :
                <ul>
                    <li>Bring movie night once per month</li>
                    <li>Getting recognized by other micronations and nations</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>Now, you deicide. Will you vote for Kittanaa, with his small, but realistic promises. Or will you vote for Neon Sheep with his bigger dreams ? Because with a population of only 10
                citizens, your vote truly matters. For now, none of the candidates has faced some real issues with his campaign but after all, it is only the first day and the election is in 19 days,
                on may 30th so everything can still change.
